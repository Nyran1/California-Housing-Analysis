ANALYSIS APPROACH

Our analysis follows a structured workflow, starting with data preprocessing and cleaning. We then perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables. Throughout the process, we leverage various data visualization techniques to present the findings effectively.

The California Housing Analysis project showcases our proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. By exploring the dataset, we aim to uncover key trends, patterns, and factors that influence the housing market in California.
